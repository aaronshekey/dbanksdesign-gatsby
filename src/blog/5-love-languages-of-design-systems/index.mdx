This is a silly thought I had. 

If you aren't familiar with the 5 love languages, it is a book, which to be honest did actually have a profound effect on my relationship and I think has made me a better partner. 

The gist of love languages is that there are types of ways to express love, and each person prefers certain types of expressions of love, both to give and recieve. I for example prefer to show love through gift giving and acts of service, and I prefer to recieve love through words of affirmation.

Enough about me, let's dive into how the love languages relate to design systems.
